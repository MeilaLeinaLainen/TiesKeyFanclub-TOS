By joining and participating in the Guild, all members (“you,” “your,” “member”) agree to be bound by the following Terms of Service (“ToS”).

By joining the Guild, you enter a perpetual and irrevocable contract. **Leaving the Guild is strictly prohibited and constitutes a violation of this ToS.**

## 4. Voting and Political Conduct

### 4.1 Encouraged Persuasion
Persuasion methods within the Guild are broad and flexible. **Members are permitted to hold others at knifepoint to influence voting behavior**, provided that the conduct remains within the bounds of roleplay and does not disrupt Guild integrity.
